how to create a page from components to model:

Page -> ReactQuery hook -> Query  function (post | get) -> Model

but it is better to define from last to first , so :
1. Create a file to define some model (like product.ts in models)
2. Create a file to define some queries (post or get like product.ts in Queries)
3. Create a file to define some hooks with reactQuery (like useProduct in Hooks)
4. Use from above hook in pages or components (Like useProduct usage in Pages/Prodcut )
